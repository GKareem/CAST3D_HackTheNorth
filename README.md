# CAST3D-Scanner_for_Medicinal_Casts-HackTheNorth2020++
With many previous fractures and injuries under my belt and an interest in 3D printing, the thought of developing a method of creating splints for those who are injured arises. Typically-used splint and cast materials are often quite heavy, lack water resistance, lack airflow, and a few other drawbacks. However, when searching through the 3D printing forums, a talented few constructed their own 3D printed casts. On the other hand of the talented few, there was little efficiency when attempting to scan one's arm, leg, etc… The most common method of scanning was photogrammetry using cameras. Most cameras used in these situations capture little to no depth and the process would take hours to perform without the right equipment. With the rise of LiDAR sensors, one common theme took hold, which was that of scanning objects. LiDAR has become very accessible at low costs. Taking into account all the factors listed, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to make an MRI-like machine that scans a patient's arm.
